What is operator overloading?
- + / * ==

+ is the only 1 oper overl

In b/w numbers if we use + it will act as addition. ex: 8+8 = 16
In b/w Strings if we use + it will act as contination. ex: "Siri"+"Dhatrika" = SiriDhatrika

Ex: 8+8 = 16
"Siri"+"Dhatrika" = Siri Dhatrika
1+1+"Dhatrika"   =
"Dhatrika"+1+1   =
(1+1)+"Dhatrika" =
"Dhatrika"+(1+1) =
"Dhatrika"+(1+1)+"Siri"+23+24=


What is Operators and Operands?


OOPS: Object Oriented Programming System: C++, Java, Python, C#,Objective-C, PHP, JavaScript
POPS: COBOL, C, BASIC, PASCAL, C++
EX: Pen or chair or animals or human Logical Object

What is Object?: The object can be either will exist logical or physically
Ex: Physicallly Oj: Laptop, Animals, Chair, Pen, Items...
    Logical Oject: MS WORD, etc....
The objects contains 3 characterstics: Identity, Behiour(actions), Properties (data) or state
1111,
Ex: Dog dog2 = new Dog();//10101
 Dog dog1 = new Dog();//2202

1. object is instance of an class.
What is class?
  contains: Constro, Data (fields), methods, blocks, nested class

Constructor: Special method in java.

Naming Conventions:
Class: Demo ex: Exception or Thread
Interface: Ex: Runnable
Method: println(), actionPerformed()
Variable:
Constructors:
Constants: static final PAN_CARD = "PANCARD", PANCARD, STATUS,
PACKAGES: com.google

What is
Ex: class A{


    }

How many types of Constructors?
1. Default Constru
    Purpose:
        Java Compiler will add in our .class
2. Paramete

//
javap - java profile
JDecompiler

Constrcot overloading: More than 1 constructor if you have in your class defination will called as constroctor overloading

they some rules:

1. Constructor should same
2. Constructor parameters should differernt data types or no of arugments
Ex:
   A{
        //0- param
        A(){

        }
        //1-param - int param
        A(int a){

        }

         //1-param  long, boolean, String
         A(long a){

         }
         A(int a, int b){

         }

   }

10.0, 90.0 -- by default consider as double java compiler
10, 20, 30 --> by default con as int in java(compiler)

10L -- automatic type promotion - up-casting
int-long-double-float

byte <-- short <-- int
(short)10 -> explicityl de-promotion - down casting

this keyword:
 this? --> it will refer to current class object (reference)

 1.  using this keyword we can differentiate the instnace variables and (contr, method ) parameter variables.
 2.  we can also use this keyword as a parameter in the contructors.

 3. this() contructor we can also invoke one cn from another con.
 4. using this keyword we can call instance methods in the class


Method:

What is method? also function? expose the behivour (action) an object

Types methods? 1. instance method (non-static method) 2. static method.

ex: static methods

public static void n(){

}

A.n();//



ex: instance method:
public void n(){

}

What is Method Overloading?
with in the class multiple mehtods having same name but with different paratermest list.
Adva --> increse readability of program.

Rules: 1. different or by changing data types
        2. having no of arguments in method defination

Method Overloading and this keyword with methods

Inheritance or Is-A-Relationship.

Single inher
multi level
heriac
Multiple inh
hybrid inher

dynamic problme
extends, implements

 
create class and achive constro over
is java is having copy constructor or not?

can we call sub class(child) constructor from super(parent) class

2 types blocks in java

1. Instance (initializer) block
2. static block

Method Overriding:
u must maintain the relationship --> Inheritance
